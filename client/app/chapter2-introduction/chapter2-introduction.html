<p class="indent">In this chapter we focus on what happens if we apply a force or group of forces to different points on a tooth. To be able to analyze and predict the effect of a force on tooth movement, the concept of <i>equivalent system</i> is discussed. Further, we introduce the concept of <i>couple</i>, its characteristics, and how this concept plays a significant role in bracket design, wire shape, and different types of tooth movement.</p>
