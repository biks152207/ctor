  <h1 class ="tit_1"><a id="14"></a>Tooth Movement in Response to Force</h1>
<p class="indent">In response to the application of a force, the tooth moves along the line of action of the force. This is true only if the force passes through the center of resistance of a tooth. In this situation, it is easy to calculate the amount of tooth movement because both crown and apex of the tooth move an equal distance in the direction of the applied force. When the force is not applied through the center of resistance, a moment is created. Now, not only will the tooth move along the line of action (displacement), the tooth will also tilt (rotation) (<a href="#fig-ch2-1">Figure 2.1</a>). Pay attention that the magnitude of the tooth in both instances is the same, but in one there is an additional rotational component.</p>

<p class="indent">When we measure the magnitude of tooth movement, we usually concentrate on the center of resistance. This is because, if the tooth has some rotation in addition to the displacement, the magnitude of tooth movement will be different. Although part of the tooth may move significantly, the other part may not show any movement or even movement in opposite direction (<a href="#fig-ch2-2">Figure 2.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">To overcome this problem, the magnitude of tooth movement is always measured at the center of resistance. One way to measure the magnitude of movement is to draw a straight line from the center of resistance at the beginning of movement to its new location at the end of movement. This will only determine the magnitude of tooth movement but not the magnitude of the rotation (<a href="#fig-ch2-3">Figure 2.3</a>). Any time root movement or crown movement are the object of the treatment, that should be clarified separately.</p>

<p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-3"><span class="btn_play"></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Figure 2.3. Magnitude of tooth movement in response to the same force that has been delivered at different points of application is the same; however, amount of rotation varies.</i></p>
<p class="indent">A closer look at the movement of the center of resistance yields another conclusion: the application of force at different parts of a tooth (change in point of application) may change the amount of rotation (due to the change in the magnitude of the moment) but does not change the amount of displacement of the center of resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, application of same intrusion force on two different teeth with different inclination will displace the center of resistance the same amount but the incisal edge of the tooth with the larger inclination will move upward more, which can mistakenly be considered as additional intrusion (<a href="#fig-ch2-4">Figure 2.4</a>).</p>
