  <p class="indent">What effect would two forces have on a tooth, knowing that both forces have similar magnitudes, opposite directions, and different lines of action?</p>
  <p class="indent">To see the effect of both forces on the tooth, we need to draw the equivalent system for each force at the center of resistance. Let&#8217;s first analyze the forces in center of resistance (<a href="#fig-ch2-9">Figure 2.9</a>).</p>

The sum of two forces of the same magnitude, different lines of action, and opposite directions at the center of resistance is zero. The equivalent system shows that these forces cancel each other at the center of resistance of the tooth.</i></p>
  <p class="indent">Because the total force at the center of resistance is zero, the magnitude of displacement will also be zero. Now, let&#8217;s see what moments are generated by these forces (<a href="#fig-ch2-10">Figure 2.10</a>).</p>
  <div class="background-image6">
  <p class="img"><a id="play16" onclick="play16()"><img id="animation-16" style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig10/ch2_fig100000.png"/></a></p>

  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-10"><span class="btn_play"></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Figure 2.10. The tooth receives a large moment at the center of resistance that is the sum of moments generated by each force. In this example, each 50 cN force generated a 250 cN-mm moment. At the center of resistance of the tooth, the sum of these moments results in a 500 cN-mm moment that will rotate the tooth without displacement.</i></p>
  <p class="indent">As you can see, if you apply two forces with similar magnitudes but opposite directions (as long as they do not have similar line of action), they produce a large moment at the center of resistance that will rotate the tooth but will not produce any force on the center of resistance&#8212;therefore, there will be no displacement. Because of these unique characteristic, these types of forces are called couple. A couple is a combination of two forces that can rotate the tooth (moment) without displacing it (<a href="#fig-ch2-11">Figure 2.11</a>).</p>

  <h2 class="level2"><a id="13"></a>Characteristics of a Couple</h2>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-1"></a>Magnitude of Resultant Moment</h3>
  <p class="indent-tno">If you look at the previous example carefully, you can make an observation: The moment of a couple is equal to the magnitude of one of the forces multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them.</p>
  <p class="indent-tno">Let&#8217;s put this conclusion to the test:</p>
  <p class="indent-tno">Calculate the forces and moments in the following example (<a href="#fig-ch2-12">Figure 2.12</a>).</p>
  <p class="img"><img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig12.png"/></p>
  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-12"><i>Figure 2.12. The magnitude of the moment that is produced by this couple is equal to the magnitude of one of the forces (50 cN) multiplied by the distance between them (10 mm).</i></p>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-2"></a>Direction of Resultant Moment</h3>
  <p class="indent">As discussed, in any dimension, there are only two possible directions for any moment: clockwise and counterclockwise. To change the direction of a resultant moment produced by a couple, you just need to change the senses of your forces, without the need to change the point of application or the lines of action (<a href="#fig-ch2-13">Figure 2.13</a>).</p>
  <div class="background-image7">
  <p class="img"><a id="play18" onclick="play18()"><img id="animation-18" style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig13/ch2_fig130000.png"/></a></p>
  </div>
  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-13"><span class="btn_play"></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Figure 2.13. Changing the sense of the forces will change the direction of resultant moment.</i></p>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-3"></a>Location of a Couple in Relation to the Center of Resistance</h3>
  <p class="indent">One question that comes to mind: Where should we apply a couple to produce a pure moment? Should the forces of a couple be in opposite sides of the center of resistance or can they both be on the same side? To answer this question, let&#8217;s look at some examples. Try to measure the moments in the following example (<a href="#fig-ch2-14">Figure 2.14</a>).</p>
  <p class="img"><img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig14.png"/></p>
  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-14"><i>Figure 2.14. The effect of a couple applied on different sides or on the same side of the center of resistance can be the same.</i></p>
  <p class="indent">As you can see in both cases, the magnitude of the moments are exactly the same, which brings us to the conclusion that as long as magnitudes of the forces of the couple and the distance between them do not change, they will produce the same effect. Indeed, it does not matter where they are applied in reference to the center of resistance.</p>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-4"></a>Movement of Couple Along the Line of Action</h3>
  <p class="indent">If you do not change the magnitude of the forces of a couple, but move them along their lines of action, they still produce similar moments (<a href="#fig-ch2-15">Figure 2.15</a>). This is due to the law of transmissibility that allows us to move the forces along their lines of action without changing their effects.</p>
  <p class="img"><img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig15.png"/></p>
  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-15"><i>Figure 2.15. Movement of couple along the line of action of forces will result in similar moments.</i></p>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-5"></a>Rotation of a Couple</h3>
  <p class="indent">You can rotate a couple in the same dimension clockwise or counterclockwise and still produce the same direction moment as long as you do not change the sense of your forces. The magnitude of your moment will stay the same if you keep the line of action of forces parallel and the distance between them unchanged (<a href="#fig-ch2-16">Figure 2.16</a>).</p>
  <p class="img"><img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/ch2_fig16.png"/></p>
  <p class="caption" id="fig-ch2-16"><i>Figure 2.16, Rotating a couple does not affect the magnitude and direction of the resultant moment.</i></p>
  <p class="indent">The fact that we can rotate a couple and still produce the required moment is very helpful clinically. Many times we want to correct the rotation of a tooth but, due to lack of space, the correct placement of the brackets and buttons is not possible. In these cases, we can temporary place the bracket or the button in a more accessible place, as long as they are opposite to each other so we can create two equal forces parallel to each other.</p>
  <h3 class="level3"><a id="h3-6"></a>Compensation of Force by Distance</h3>
  <p class="indent">Changing the magnitude of forces will change the magnitude of the couple. However, making corresponding changes in the distance between the lines of action of these new forces may result in a similar moment produced by a different couple (<a href="#fig-ch2-17">Figure 2.17</a>).</p>
