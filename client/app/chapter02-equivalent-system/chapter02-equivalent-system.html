<p class="indent">As described, the effect of a force that does not pass through the center of resistance is a combination of displacement and rotation. But, how can we draw these effects? One way is to just draw the force at the bracket and expect that reader to know that because that force was not applied through the center of resistance it has a hidden tendency to rotate the tooth. The other way is to isolate both the displacement and rotation effects of the force and draw them at the center of resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a 100 cN force is applied 5 mm away from the center of resistance. At the center of resistance, the tooth will receive the 100 cN force and also a 500 cN-mm tendency of rotation. To illustrate what the tooth receives at the center of resistance, we can draw the 100 cN force and 500 cN-mm moment at center of resistance (<a href="#fig-ch2-5">Figure 2.5</a>). Because these two diagrams are describing the same phenomenon, these two diagrams are called &#8220;equivalents.&#8221;</p>
