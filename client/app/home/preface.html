<p class="normal_f">Diagnosis and treatment planning has been the center of attention of orthodontic literature from the start of this specialty. These steps determine the path taken to address the problem lists of our patients. Our treatment plan is greatly influenced by our current knowledge, clinical experience, and training that we have received from our mentors and, therefore, it is a mixture of philosophy and science. Due to the philosophy component, the outcome of treatment planning among orthodontists may vary significantly. This variability not only is observed between the clinicians but also at different time points in life of an orthodontist due to the gradual changes in cosmetic values, practicality, public acceptance of the treatment, and experience of the clinician. On the other hand, how to provide the mechanical treatment and to stimulate the biological response to achieve the goals of our treatment plan is pure science and our personal opinion does not play a role in the outcome of this interaction. The purpose of this book, therefore, is not to agree or disagree with clinicians&#8217; treatment plans, but to help the clinician to execute his or her plan of treatment efficiently using scientific understanding of mechanics and biology, which we summarize as mechanotherapy.</p>
<p class="normal_f">The need for a new book that is focused on mechanotherapy was realized when we noticed our students spending many hours on diagnosis and treatment planning for their cases but, at the time of treatment, applying similar mechanics for different and even opposite malocclusions which significantly defeats the purpose of diagnosis. One of the reasons that mechanotherapy has never taken the center stage in orthodontics is due to the fact that our evaluation of treatment outcomes, even today, is based on the assessment of final result and not the path that was taken to accomplish that result, even though the path may have been unnecessary, prolonged, or harmful. The other reason behind this distance between diagnosis and mechanotherapy is that mechanical concepts have been presented in a very dry and complex fashion that many students and faculty do not dare to incorporate into their daily practice. Therefore, this book has been written in a very simple language to make the mechanotherapy a very friendly and fun subject to learn and apply in clinical treatment. To achieve this goal, many new terminologies have been introduced in this book and many old concepts have been revisited and explained in a different way. It should be emphasized that our approach does not undermine the value of classic literature but gives a practical view to those findings.</p>
<p class="normal_f">In addition to taking a new look at current understanding in mechanotherapy, many times in this book you will see that new concepts have been introduced that have never been discussed before in the literature, but they are a logical outcome of physical principles. Many of the biological concepts introduced in Volumes II or III are a summary of extensive research that has been completed by our laboratories or others in the field of tooth movement or skeletal response to mechanical stimulation during or after growth. It should be emphasized that we are still at beginning of understanding of how the body responds to mechanical stimulation and the number of questions by far bypass the number of the answers. As any other science, our lack of full understanding of the subject should not discourage us but only inspire us for future experiments that will polish our understanding closer to reality.</p>
<p class="normal_f">In this regard, the first volume of this book has been dedicated to reviewing and understanding the physical principles that can be used during treatment to achieve the desired position of the teeth with minimum adverse movement. In this volume, we treat the target of our treatment, whether it is tooth or bone, as an object and, therefore, using our understanding of physics, we define the optimal mechanical design to move the object in the desired direction. Therefore, Volume I focuses on the components that we can use to construct our mechanical design while Volume II concentrates on how to use these components at different stages of treatment to render the desire correction for a patient with dental malocclusion (orthodontic treatment). The third volume of this book has been dedicated to skeletal treatment (orthopedic treatment). In all three volumes, anytime biology changes the response of tooth or bone to mechanical stimulation, and the simple assumption of tooth and bone as a physical object does not apply anymore, new principles have been introduced.</p>
<p class="normal_f">From the educational point of view, this book has unique characteristics. First, unlike other e-books, this book is full of animations. Each concept has been illustrated and animated to help the reader to visualize different scenarios. To take advantage of this unique characteristic of the book, we recommend readers spend a few minutes reviewing the tutorial to learn how to use the animations. Second, similar to e-books, this book has incorporated many tools that facilitate the learning process such as highlighting, bookmarking, taking notes, and searching. Third, at the end of each chapter, your will find a series of questions related to that chapter that will help you to test your knowledge on the concepts that you just learned. Fourth, at the end of each chapter there is a list of suggested reading materials for readers interested to further explore some of those subjects. As mentioned, the majority of the concepts are new and unfortunately there are no other reading materials available. Due to this innovative approach, even when the reader believes that he or she is comfortable with the concept, it is highly recommended that readers follow the book chapter-by-chapter since understanding one chapter is fundamental in understanding of the next chapter.</p>
<p class="normal_f">We hope that this book will function as a reference for educators, students, and clinicians on how to custom design their mechanics based on the individual patient needs, and that they do not fall into the trap of a &#8220;one cookbook approach&#8221; for all clinical scenarios.</p>
