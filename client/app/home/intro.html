<h1 class="tit"><span>Force and Moment</span></h1>
<p class="indent"><span>This chapter introduces the basic principles of biomechanics and the different terminology used in this book to describe mechanotherapy. First, we focus on the characteristics of <i>force</i>&#8212;the tool we use to move a tooth. We describe the <i>center of resistance</i> of a tooth to help understand how a tooth reacts to forces. Finally, we describe how <i>moments</i> are produced in response to the location of the force and the center of resistance. Understanding the elements of force, center of resistance, and moments is fundamental in understanding different types of tooth.</span></p>
