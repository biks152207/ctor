<p class="normal_f">The application of sound biomechanical principles in orthodontics is a fundamental requirement for achieving optimum efficacy and predictability of any design of orthodontic appliance. Understanding the principles of biomechanics will not only allow for more efficient and expedient orthodontic treatment, but will also serve to minimize unwanted treatment side effects and possible collateral damage to the surrounding tissues of the teeth. The importance of understanding the basic principles of the biomechanics of tooth movement cannot be overstated.</p>
<p class="normal_f"><i>Mechanotherapy in Orthodontics</i> is a unique, modern, and enjoyable educational experience for the orthodontic resident, orthodontic faculty member, and the orthodontic clinician at large. It has been created by Professor Mani Alikhani, Director of the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) and members of the CTOR team at New York University College of Dentistry.</p>
<p class="normal_f">This first volume addresses the essential laws that govern tooth movement. There have been numerous orthodontic appliances introduced over the past 100 years and yet the underlying laws of Physics have not changed. Despite this caveat, it is an accepted fact that often orthodontic treatment time is spent managing the adverse side effects brought about by improper use of biomechanics. <i>Mechanotherapy in Orthodontics</i> clearly and unequivocally presents these sound biomechanical principles with the use of a modern interactive and animated format intended to improve the orthodontic experience for the patient and orthodontist. Readers will find this new format to perfectly complement the biomechanical insights offered by the author. The summaries at the end of each chapter and learning features are value added inclusions</p>
<p class="normal_f">I fully expect <i>Mechanotherapy in Orthodontics</i> by Professor Mani Alikhani to be a valuable staple for every orthodontic department biomechanics curriculum and orthodontist world-wide. It is simply that good!</p>
