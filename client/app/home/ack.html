<p class="normal_f">This project was only possible thanks to the dedication of a few dreamers. We wish to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Chinapa Sangsuwon for her utmost dedication to this book and her belief in its purpose. We would like to thank her for her artful animations and for overseeing the creation of this project.</p>
<p class="normal_f">We also want to thank our orthodontic residents for their contribution and support, as well as for their pointed questions on the subject that motivated us to develop a new, better tool to teach the most important principles in orthodontics. Finally, we wish to express our love and gratitude to our families for their constant support, endless nagging, and unconditional love throughout the period of creating this book.</p>
